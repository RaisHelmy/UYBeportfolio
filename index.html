                        one of our group members gave a great suggestion for our business<br>idea. It was the business of Design and Web which is shown in Picture 1 above.<br>After all of us tried to think of this idea over and over again, we all agreed<br>with
                        this business idea as the decision we made to run our real company<br>business. Plus, We never gave excuses for ourselves to step back and give up,<br>but we always insisted to move forward to run our company business because this<br>is
                        the way how we will achieve our glorious success in our future.<br></h3>

        <p class="text-center"><br><br>First and foremost, Rais Helmy Bin Sapiullah (BI17210297)<br>was the first member who raised his hand up and volunteered himself to become<br>the leader of our business group. All of us agreed that he was worth of being<br>our great leader
            because he had gone through those tough experiences before he<br>furthered his studies in Universiti Malaysia Sabah Kampus Antarabangsa Labuan<br>(UMSKAL). No matter what we face what will come to us, we all believed in<br>ourselves and succeeded
            everything successfully together with our great leader<br>in the future. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
        <p class="text-center">Before beginning our company business, it was compulsory<br>for all of us to start planning our strategies for the purpose of running our<br>group business. Of course, we would not forget the learnings of Business Model<br>Canvas (BMC) because
            it was useful and acceptable for the business people to<br>apply it to do their business. With the nine (9) aspects in BMC, they were very<br>much convenient for us to draw and write our strategical ideas to plan up everything<br>to run our
            business easily. Although we took a lot of time to plan everything<br>properly, but we still stayed calm and chilled down when planning our strategies<br>for our group business. The reason for that is to not drag all of us into<br>chaotic
            mess if we are staying ourselves in the state of confusion. So, it is<br>better to stay being calm as well in order to smoothen the process of running<br>our company business.<br></p>

                    <h3 class="text-muted section-subheading" style="height: 260px;">The promotion<br>of product means disseminating the information about the product, product line,<br>brand and company to the prospective buyers with the intent to generate sales<br>and develop a brand loyalty. The promotion of product
                        is important to our<br>company or group business because it can function to stimulate demand for a<br>product by creating awareness and interest among our customers. Plus, it can<br>even stabilize sales by highlighting the importance
                        and features of the<br>product.<br></h3>
                    <h3 class="text-muted section-subheading" style="height: 113px;">As for the way we promoted our product in our business of<br>“Design &amp; Website”, we were applying two methods only. So, the first method<br>will be offline activity, while the second one will be online activity.<br></h3>
                    <h3 class="text-muted section-subheading"
                        style="height: 232px;">As for the<br>first method – offline activity, we will use “face to face” mode to serve our<br>customers. It is because it will be easy for us to jot down the customers`<br>informational needs clearly when they want to ask to make
                        an order for their<br>products from our company business. Of course, we will reconfirm or repeat<br>everything what our customers have ordered accordingly in their order list.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></h3>

        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>I.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Collaboration</strong><br>When dealing with some<br>problems which came to affect
            our business rate, all of us were working together<br>as one to overcome the problems until they were solved successfully. This<br>collaboration consisted of three important aspects we had learnt and they were<br>“Teamwork, Team Cooperation
            &amp; Team Spirit”.<br></p>
        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>II.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Learn Something New</strong><br><br><br>Throughout the duties we<br>did together, it was not a waste of time for us to work
            in this group business.<br>We spent our bloody and sweaty effort on running this company business. Yes, it<br>consumed a lot of our energies but it was worth. Once we had tasted those hard<br>experiences just like living in a midst of hardship,
            we were glad to learn<br>something new. With those great experiences, we will appreciate and treasure<br>them as the new memories of our lifetime.<br></p>

            business would only<br>cost us our time and the utilities of our university, but there is no financial<br>cost involved in our business. Without the financial cost, we still maximized<br>our profit which exceeded our target (RM500) unexpectedly
            in the end. It was<br>considered as the best record for our business group.<br></p>

            to back up one<br>another. It is because we assumed this business group as our new home and we<br>also worked together as one big family. Therefore, we never left one another<br>alone or behind to deal with the problems.<br></p>
        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>V.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Satisfaction</strong>&nbsp;<br>Our Customers were happy<br>when receiving their products because we always provided them with
            our good<br>quality services. Most of them wished that we could continue on our company<br>business in the future too. Hopefully, we can continue to serve them well in<br>our business if it is only possible in our future.<br></p>

        <h2 class="text-uppercase text-center section-heading"><strong>2.1 Problems</strong><br></h2>
        <p class="text-center d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The Assessment and Program</strong><br><br><br><br>All of our<br>group members were given a lot of assessments that needed to be
            done<br>completely. The assessments must be passed up or handed in according to the<br>exact dates of submission. Plus, most of us were first year students and it was<br>compulsory to join the organized programs actively in the first year.
            So, there<br>would be more upcoming events approaching us to participate. Therefore, it was hard<br>for us to arrange our schedule to run our company business.<br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
        <p class="text-center d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The Laptop Problems</strong><br><br><br>Most of our laptops were only<br>ordinary, but not the high quality laptops. We didn’t have any laptops which<br>can do
            everything miraculously in our business company. So, it would be very<br>difficult to design our products for our customers. It is because many<br>softwares did not contain enough good quality uses or aspects which are basically<br>based on
            the art and creativity. Moreover, we also faced a lot of problems such<br>as lagging screen, full memory, unreachable internet and others.<br></p>
        <p class="text-center d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>C.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The</strong><br><strong>Fussy Customers</strong><br><br><br>Some of our customers were<br>really picky, but they were decisive too. They had cultivated
            some attitudes<br>that we did not wish to see. They knew what they wanted, how they wanted it and<br>sometimes they would even offer some advises on how best to provide them with<br>what and how they wanted something.<br></p>

        <h2 class="text-uppercase text-center section-heading"><strong>2.2 SOLUTIONS</strong><br></h2>
        <p class="text-center d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Time</strong><br><strong>Management</strong><br><br>We will start learning to<br>manage to organize and plan how to divide our time between the incoming jobs<br>and
            our studies. Since there have many events and assessments we need to take<br>part, we must plan our daily schedule very well. Therefore, a good time<br>management enables us to work smarter and work in a shorter time.<br></p>
        <p class="text-center d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Advanced</strong><br><strong>Equipment</strong><br><br>We must upgrade our laptop<br>(RAM, graphics, storage) and make sure that laptop always stays in a good<br>condition in order
            to complete the jobs without wasting any time. In addition,<br>we can always check and update the latest version of Window. Plus, we can<br>download various software and applications for designing poster and editing<br>video.<br></p>
        <p class="text-center d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>C.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Maintain&nbsp;Our Customer Services</strong><br><br><br>We must lower our voice and<br>speak softly when having conversation with our customers. If the customer
            gets<br>louder, we must start speaking more slowly and in a lower tone. So, it will<br>avoid for having arguments with our customers. However, we should stay calm<br>when facing those fussy customers&nbsp;and discuss a better solution to try
            to<br>fulfill them. If it is possible, we will never take it personally. Plus, we will<br>always speak to the issue at hand and do not get personal, even if the customer<br>does.<br></p>
        <p class="text-center d-flex justify-content-center"><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>D.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Maintain</strong><br><strong>Relationship Between Customers</strong><br><br><br><br>Communication is an<br>essential way to build customer relationship. If we are
            always having a good<br>conversation with our customers to make sure that we fully understand their<br>demands before taking over the jobs. As for those frequently customers, we will<br>always remember their requirements. Of course, we must
            treat them being a<br>friend or chitchat with them too.<br></p>

            getting more developed and advanced everywhere. Many laptops will<br>have some new and different software systems. With the uses of computer<br>software systems, we will normally emphasize more about the art and creativity<br>to design the
